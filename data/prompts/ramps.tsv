oriented/ramp_up_n.png	Pixel art, 200x200 tile, top-down orthographic ramp overlay only. Extremely simple Age of Empires 2 style. Straight north-south ramp segment spanning fully from bottom edge to top edge. The bottom (south) side is lower elevation; the top (north) side is higher elevation. Shows a gradual slope/incline going UP toward the north with visible gradient shading from low to high. Rocky/earth texture showing the slope surface. Ramp edges along the sides. Match thickness, palette, and line weight across all ramp sprites. Thick outlines, limited palette, no fine details, clean silhouette, readable at a glance. Full-tile coverage, no border frame. Solid bright royal purple background (pure royal purple #7851A9), full frame, no transparency.
