# Inter-role coordination system
# Allows agents to communicate needs across role boundaries:
# - Gatherer requests protection from Fighter when under attack
# - Fighter requests defensive structures from Builder when seeing threats
# - Builder responds to defense requests by prioritizing walls/towers

# This file is designed to be used alongside the include-based ai system.
# It doesn't import ai_core to avoid type namespace conflicts.
