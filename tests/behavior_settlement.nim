## Behavioral tests for town expansion / settler migration mechanic.
## Verifies that towns can split when population exceeds threshold,
## settlers found new towns at appropriate distances, and villagers
## redistribute correctly across settlements.
##
## These tests define the expected behavior for the settler migration system.
## They depend on the instrumentation from tv-72vq8 being in place.
