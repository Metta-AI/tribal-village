## perf_actions.nim - Benchmark test for actions subsystem performance
##
## Tests performance optimizations in action processing:
## - Reusable constructionBuilders table (avoids per-step allocation)
## - Pre-computed team pop caps/counts (O(1) lookup for monk conversion)
## - Reusable agentOrder array (shuffle in place)
##
## Run: nim c -r -d:release --path:src tests/perf_actions.nim
