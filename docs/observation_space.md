# Observation Space Reference

Date: 2026-01-31
Owner: Engineering / AI
Status: Draft

## Shape and layout
- **Spatial size:** `ObservationWidth` x `ObservationHeight` = **11 x 11**.
- **Radius:** `ObservationRadius` = 5 (centered on the agent).
- **Layers:** `ObservationLayers` = `ord(ObservationName.high) + 1` = **96**.
- **Type:** `uint8` values per layer cell.

The canonical enum lives in `src/types.nim` under `ObservationName`.

## Layer groups
The observation tensor is grouped into three conceptual blocks:

are written to the same layer for that tile.

not have corresponding observation layers (they are `BackgroundThingKinds`).

### 3) Meta layers (15 layers, indices 81-95)

These layers encode non-spatial entity state and game mechanics.

| Index | Layer Name | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 81 | `TeamLayer` | Team ID + 1 (0 = neutral/none) |
| 82 | `AgentOrientationLayer` | Orientation enum + 1 (0 = none/not an agent) |
| 83 | `AgentUnitClassLayer` | Unit class enum + 1 (0 = none/not an agent) |

| 85 | `TintLayer` | Action/combat tint codes (see below) |
| 86 | `RallyPointLayer` | 1 if a friendly building has its rally point here |
| 87 | `BiomeLayer` | Biome type enum value |
| 88 | `GarrisonCountLayer` | Garrison fill ratio: `(count * 255) div capacity` |
| 89 | `RelicCountLayer` | Monastery relic count (direct value, 0-255) |
| 90 | `ProductionQueueLenLayer` | Units in production queue (direct value, 0-255) |
| 91 | `BuildingHpLayer` | Building HP ratio: `(hp * 255) div maxHp` |
| 92 | `MonkFaithLayer` | Monk faith ratio: `(faith * 255) div MonkMaxFaith` |
| 93 | `TrebuchetPackedLayer` | 1 if trebuchet is packed (mobile), 0 if unpacked |
| 94 | `UnitStanceLayer` | AgentStance enum + 1 (0 = not an agent) |
| 95 | `ObscuredLayer` | 1 when target tile is above observer elevation |

**Layer details:**

- `GarrisonCountLayer`: Only non-zero for garrisonable buildings (TownCenter,
  Castle, GuardTower, House).
- `RelicCountLayer`: Only non-zero for Monasteries with garrisoned relics.
- `ProductionQueueLenLayer`: Number of units in a building's production queue
  (max 10 typically).
- `BuildingHpLayer`: Non-zero for any building with `maxHp > 0`.
- `MonkFaithLayer`: Non-zero only for Monk agents with faith > 0.
- `TrebuchetPackedLayer`: Only non-zero for Trebuchet agents.
- `UnitStanceLayer`: Values are 1=Aggressive, 2=Defensive, 3=StandGround,
  4=NoAttack.
- `ObscuredLayer`: Applied in the FFI path (`src/ffi.nim`); when a tile is
  obscured, other layers for that tile are zeroed.

## Action tint codes (TintLayer)
Defined in `src/types.nim`:

**Attack codes (per unit class):**
- `ActionTintNone` = 0
- `ActionTintAttackVillager` = 1
- `ActionTintAttackManAtArms` = 2
- `ActionTintAttackArcher` = 3
- `ActionTintAttackScout` = 4
- `ActionTintAttackKnight` = 5
- `ActionTintAttackMonk` = 6
- `ActionTintAttackBatteringRam` = 7
- `ActionTintAttackMangonel` = 8
- `ActionTintAttackTrebuchet` = 9
- `ActionTintAttackBoat` = 10
- `ActionTintAttackTower` = 11
- `ActionTintAttackCastle` = 12

**Counter/bonus codes:**
- `ActionTintAttackBonus` = 13 (generic bonus, rarely used)
- `ActionTintBonusArcher` = 14 (archer counter bonus vs infantry)
- `ActionTintBonusInfantry` = 15 (infantry counter bonus vs cavalry)
- `ActionTintBonusScout` = 16 (scout counter bonus vs archers)
- `ActionTintBonusKnight` = 17 (knight counter bonus vs archers)
- `ActionTintBonusBatteringRam` = 18 (battering ram siege bonus vs structures)
- `ActionTintBonusMangonel` = 19 (mangonel siege bonus vs structures)
- `ActionTintBonusTrebuchet` = 20 (trebuchet siege bonus vs structures)
- `ActionTintShield` = 21

**Heal codes:**
- `ActionTintHealMonk` = 30
- `ActionTintHealBread` = 31

**Castle unique unit attack tints (40-48):**
- `ActionTintAttackSamurai` = 40 through `ActionTintAttackKing` = 48

**Unit upgrade tier attack tints (49-57):**
- `ActionTintAttackLongSwordsman` = 49 through `ActionTintAttackScorpion` = 57

**Special codes:**
- `ActionTintDeath` = 60 (death animation tint at kill location)
- `ActionTintMixed` = 200 (multiple events overlap on same tile)

These codes are written into the tint layer per world tile as events occur.

## Update mechanics
- `updateObservations()` is a no-op; observations are rebuilt in batch at the
  end of each `step()` call for efficiency.
- `rebuildObservations()` reconstructs full observation buffers from scratch
  (O(agents * tiles) instead of O(updates * agents)).
- The FFI entrypoints copy the buffer directly and apply the obscured mask.

Notes:
- Inventory counts are not encoded in the spatial layers. Inventory update
  hooks exist but are currently no-ops, so inventories must be tracked outside
  the observation tensor.

If you change the observation layout (layers or meanings), update:
- `ObservationName` and related constants in `src/types.nim`.
- Any docs or README sections describing the observation space.
- Any Python wrappers that assume layer indices.
