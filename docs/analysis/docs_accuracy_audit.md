## Verified Accurate Documentation

| `economy_respawn.md` | ✅ Accurate | Stockpile/inventory mechanics correct |
| `ai_system.md` | ✅ Accurate | Include chain, role assignment, OptionDef system all verified |

### Configuration & Build

| Document | Status | Notes |

## Inaccuracies Found (Requires Update)

### 1. `action_space.md` - Verb Count Mismatch

**Location:** Lines 17-19, 29-41

**Issue:** Documents 10 verbs (verb 0-9) but code has 11 verbs.

**Current Doc:**
```
- **10 verbs** x **25 arguments** = **250 total actions**
```

**Actual Code (`src/common_types.nim:130`):**
```nim
ActionVerbCount* = 11  # Added set rally point action (verb 10)
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update verb count from 10 to 11
- Add verb 10 (`set_rally_point`) to the verb reference table
- Update total action space from 250 to 275

---

### 2. `action_space.md` - Missing Verb 10

**Location:** Verb Reference table (lines 29-41)

**Missing Entry:**
```
| 10 | set_rally_point | Set rally point on building | 0-7 (directions) |
```

---

### 3. `economy_respawn.md` - Market Trading Mechanics

**Location:** Lines 48-56

**Issue:** Documents legacy fixed-ratio market trading, but code has AoE2-style dynamic pricing.

**Current Doc:**
```
- Gold -> food at `DefaultMarketBuyFoodNumerator/Denominator` (1/1).
- Wood/stone/food -> gold at `DefaultMarketSellNumerator/Denominator` (1/2).
```

**Actual Code (`src/environment.nim:57-65`):**
```nim
MarketBasePrice* = 100        # Base price: 100 gold per 100 resources
MarketMinPrice* = 20          # Minimum price floor
MarketMaxPrice* = 300         # Maximum price ceiling
MarketBuyPriceIncrease* = 3   # Price increase per buy transaction
MarketSellPriceDecrease* = 3  # Price decrease per sell transaction
```

**Fix Required:** Update market section to describe dynamic AoE2-style pricing.

---

### 4. `observation_space.md` - Trebuchet Attack Tint Typo

**Location:** Line 165

**Issue:** Minor - documents `ActionTintAttackTrebuchet = 9` which is correct, but the doc could note that Trebuchet also has `TrebuchetPackedLayer` for pack/unpack state.

**Status:** Low priority, observation is accurate but could be enhanced.

---

## Documentation Quality Observations

### Well-Documented Areas
- **Unit stats** in `configuration.md` are comprehensive and accurate
- **Victory conditions** in `game_logic.md` cover all modes
- **AI system** documentation is thorough with include chain explained
- **Observation tensor** layout is clearly documented with layer indices

### Areas That Could Use Enhancement
- **Castle unique units** - stats are in `constants.nim` but not fully documented
- **Unit upgrade tiers** - LongSwordsman/Champion etc. stats in code but not in combat.md
- **Technology costs** - AoE2-style tech tree costs are in constants.nim but not documented

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1 (Should Fix)
1. Update `action_space.md` verb count to 11 and add `set_rally_point`
2. Update `economy_respawn.md` market trading to reflect dynamic pricing

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
3. Add castle unique unit stats to `combat.md` or `configuration.md`
4. Document unit upgrade tier stats (LongSwordsman, Champion, etc.)
5. Add technology cost reference section

## Conclusion

The documentation is generally accurate and well-maintained. Two substantive fixes are needed:
1. Action space verb count (10→11)
2. Market trading mechanics (fixed→dynamic pricing)

The rest of the documentation accurately reflects the current game mechanics.
